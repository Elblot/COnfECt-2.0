***********COnfECt***********

Introduction
============

COnfECt is a KTail-based tool that generate models of different
components of the system, from execution traces of the general system as input.
No information is provided to identify components. 
It Generates a Labeled Transition System (LTS) from each components, 
linked with call/return labels.
We propose different strategies, leading to different generalisation levels.


For Users
=========

Usage : MainC -d <directory> -a <algorithm> -o <destination>

algorithm : weak, strong, strict

Options :
-t	show the duration of each step of the program
-k	choose the number of k-futur (not implemented, 2 is used)
-w	show temporal files used to make .dot files
-c	hide call/return transitions


Input syntax
============

Input must be a directory with files which contain events under that form :

<label>(<param1>;<param2>;<param3>...)
<label>(<param1>;<param2>;<param3>...)
...

The Mapper tool can help you to make these lines. The <param> don't contain 
values as the Mapper do. An option of the Mapper exist for this specific
case. 


Correlation
===========

A Correlation Coefficient is used to evaluate the correlation of successive 
events. In this implementation, we use a coefficient based on frequency.
User must specify the threshold in the code.


Synchronisation Strategies
==========================

There are 3 different strategies for 3 different generalisation levels :

strict : create LTS composed of acyclic paths only in order to
limit the over-generalisation problem.

strong : it provides more over-generalised models by generating
callable-complete LTS.

weak : it aims at reducing the number of components and allows 
repetitive component calls.


Files generated 
===============

Many trace files are generated during the Correlation process to separate sequences of events that come from different components.
These files are used in the Synchronisation process for Clustering of LTSs.
Then the KTail process generates the .dot and .png files, that represente these traces.
A RESULTAT file is also created, with statistics of every graph and global statistics.
